# TradeOgre Python Grid Bot - Security Audit Report

**Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Auditor:** OpenHands AI Security Auditor  
**Repository:** cornexd/MM-bot-tradeogre  

## 🔍 Executive Summary

The TradeOgrePyGridBot is a basic market-making bot for TradeOgre exchange that implements a grid trading strategy. While the core functionality is sound, the codebase contains **multiple critical security vulnerabilities** and lacks essential safety features required for production trading.

**Risk Level: HIGH** ⚠️

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues

### 1. Credential Management (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: API keys stored in plain text files with hardcoded paths
- **Risk**: Credential exposure, unauthorized access to trading account
- **Location**: `run.py:59`, `tradeogre.py:47-50`
- **Impact**: Complete account compromise if file system is breached

### 2. Input Validation (HIGH)
- **Issue**: No validation of API responses or user inputs
- **Risk**: Potential for malformed data to cause crashes or unexpected behavior
- **Location**: Throughout codebase, especially `run.py:73-84`
- **Impact**: Bot crashes, incorrect trades, potential financial loss

### 3. Error Handling (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Minimal error handling for API failures or network issues
- **Risk**: Bot crashes on API errors, leaving orphaned orders
- **Location**: All API calls in `run.py`
- **Impact**: Uncontrolled trading state, potential financial loss

### 4. Infinite Loop Without Exit Conditions (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Main trading loop runs indefinitely with no emergency stops
- **Risk**: Bot continues trading even during market crashes or API issues
- **Location**: `run.py:123-162`
- **Impact**: Unlimited financial exposure

### 5. No Rate Limiting Protection (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: Basic sleep delays but no sophisticated rate limiting
- **Risk**: API rate limit violations leading to account suspension
- **Location**: `run.py:115`, `run.py:125`
- **Impact**: Trading interruption, potential account penalties

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Implement secure credential management** using environment variables
2. **Add comprehensive error handling** for all API calls
3. **Implement input validation** for all user inputs and API responses
4. **Add emergency stop mechanisms** and position limits
5. **Implement proper logging** with security event tracking

### Medium-term Improvements:
1. **Add dry-run/paper trading mode** for testing
2. **Implement position and risk management** controls
3. **Add monitoring and alerting** capabilities
4. **Create configuration management** system
5. **Add comprehensive testing** suite

## ⚙️ API Compatibility Assessment

### Current Status: ✅ COMPATIBLE
- TradeOgre API v1 endpoints are still active and functional
- AEGS-USDT pair is available and trading
- API response format matches expected structure
- Rate limiting appears to be 5-second intervals (as implemented)

### Tested Endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/v1/markets` - Working
- ✅ `/api/v1/ticker/{market}` - Working  
- ✅ `/api/v1/orders/{market}` - Working
- ✅ Authentication endpoints - Structure unchanged

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions for AEGS-USDT

### Prerequisites:
1. TradeOgre account with API access enabled
2. Python 3.7+ environment
3. USDT balance for initial grid setup
4. AEGS balance for selling (if starting with sell-side bias)

### Configuration Steps:
1. **Create secure API key file**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/tradeogre
   echo "YOUR_API_KEY" > ~/.config/tradeogre/api.key
   echo "YOUR_API_SECRET" >> ~/.config/tradeogre/api.key
   chmod 600 ~/.config/tradeogre/api.key
   ```

2. **Update bot configuration** in `run.py`:
   ```python
   bot_ticker = 'AEGS-USDT'  # Target pair
   bot_balance = 100         # Amount of AEGS to trade
   api_file_uri = os.path.expanduser('~/.config/tradeogre/api.key')
   buffer = 0.00001         # Price buffer (adjust based on volatility)
   upper_bound = 0.001      # Upper price limit
   grid_count = 10          # Number of grid levels
   ```

### Recommended Parameters for AEGS-USDT:
- **Grid Count**: 8-12 levels
- **Buffer**: 0.00001 USDT (adjust based on spread)
- **Upper Bound**: Set 20-30% above current ask price
- **Trade Size**: Start with small amounts (10-50 AEGS per level)
- **Refresh Rate**: 5-10 seconds (current: 5 seconds)

## 🚨 Risk Controls Implementation

### Essential Risk Controls:
1. **Maximum Position Limits**:
   ```python
   MAX_TOTAL_POSITION = 1000  # Maximum AEGS exposure
   MAX_ORDERS_PER_SIDE = 10   # Limit concurrent orders
   ```

2. **Emergency Stop Conditions**:
   ```python
   EMERGENCY_STOP_CONDITIONS = {
       'max_consecutive_failures': 5,
       'price_deviation_threshold': 0.5,  # 50% price movement
       'max_daily_loss': 100  # USDT
   }
   ```

3. **Circuit Breakers**:
   - Stop trading if price moves >50% in 1 hour
   - Pause on 5 consecutive API failures
   - Daily loss limits

### Monitoring Requirements:
1. **Real-time Alerts**:
   - Order fill notifications
   - API failure alerts
   - Position limit warnings
   - Emergency stop triggers

2. **Logging Requirements**:
   - All trades with timestamps
   - API errors and responses
   - Position changes
   - P&L tracking

## 📊 Testing Recommendations

### Before Live Trading:
1. **Paper Trading Mode**: Test with simulated orders
2. **Small Position Testing**: Start with minimal amounts
3. **API Connectivity Testing**: Verify all endpoints work
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Test network failures, API errors
5. **Emergency Stop Testing**: Verify stop mechanisms work

### Ongoing Monitoring:
1. **Daily P&L Review**: Track performance metrics
2. **Order Book Analysis**: Monitor market depth changes
3. **API Performance**: Track response times and errors
4. **Position Reconciliation**: Verify bot state matches exchange

## 🔧 Code Quality Issues

### Major Issues:
1. **No configuration management** - All settings hardcoded
2. **Poor error handling** - No graceful degradation
3. **No logging framework** - Only basic print statements
4. **No testing** - No unit or integration tests
5. **Hardcoded file paths** - Not portable across systems

### Recommended Improvements:
1. Implement configuration file system (YAML/JSON)
2. Add comprehensive logging with rotation
3. Create unit and integration test suite
4. Add type hints and documentation
5. Implement proper exception handling

## ✅ Final Safety Checklist

### Before Running Live:
- [ ] API credentials secured with proper permissions
- [ ] Configuration reviewed and validated
- [ ] Emergency stop mechanisms tested
- [ ] Position limits configured appropriately
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Paper trading completed successfully
- [ ] Small position testing completed
- [ ] Risk management parameters validated
- [ ] Legal and compliance requirements met

### Ongoing Requirements:
- [ ] Daily position reconciliation
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Risk parameter adjustments

## 🎯 Conclusion

The TradeOgrePyGridBot has a solid foundation for grid trading but requires significant security hardening before production use. The API compatibility is confirmed, but the lack of proper error handling, security controls, and risk management makes it unsuitable for live trading without modifications.

**Recommendation**: Implement the security fixes and risk controls outlined in this report before considering live deployment. Start with paper trading and gradually scale up position sizes after thorough testing.
